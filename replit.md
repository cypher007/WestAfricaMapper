# ECOWAS ISP Dominance Map

## Overview

This is an interactive web mapping application that visualizes the dominance of foreign Internet Service Provider (ISP) companies in West African ECOWAS countries. The application displays how foreign telecommunications companies control internet infrastructure across the region, highlighting patterns of digital dependency that often follow historical colonial boundaries.

The application is built as a simple client-side web application with a Python HTTP server for local development and deployment.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Technology Stack**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Mapping Library**: Leaflet.js for interactive mapping capabilities
- **Styling**: Custom CSS with modern design patterns including gradients and responsive layouts
- **Language**: French-language interface targeting West African users

### Backend Architecture
- **Server**: Simple Python HTTP server using `http.server` module
- **Purpose**: Static file serving with CORS headers for development
- **Port**: Runs on port 5000 by default
- **Host**: Configured for 0.0.0.0 to allow external access

### Data Architecture
- **Geographic Data**: GeoJSON format for country boundaries and geographic features
- **ISP Data**: JavaScript objects containing operator information, market share, and dominance patterns
- **Structure**: Embedded data within JavaScript files (no external database)

## Key Components

### 1. Web Application (`index.html`)
- Main application entry point with French-language interface
- Includes controls for toggling different map layers
- Loading overlay for user experience
- Responsive design with modern typography (Inter font)

### 2. Interactive Map (`js/map.js`)
- Leaflet-based mapping functionality
- Country-specific ISP dominance data for ECOWAS nations
- Multiple overlay layers for different data visualizations
- Color-coded countries based on dominant foreign operator origin

### 3. Geographic Data (`data/cedeao_countries.geojson`)
- GeoJSON format containing ECOWAS country boundaries
- Properties include country names in French and English, ISO codes, and capitals
- Structured for easy integration with Leaflet mapping

### 4. Visual Styling (`css/styles.css`)
- Modern CSS with gradient backgrounds and professional typography
- Responsive design principles
- Custom styling for map controls and legends

### 5. Development Server (`server.py`)
- Custom HTTP request handler extending SimpleHTTPRequestHandler
- CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Proper MIME type handling for GeoJSON files
- Error handling and user-friendly console output

## Data Flow

1. **Application Start**: Python server serves static files from project root
2. **Page Load**: Browser loads HTML, CSS, and JavaScript assets
3. **Map Initialization**: Leaflet initializes with base map tiles
4. **Data Loading**: GeoJSON country boundaries loaded and parsed
5. **Data Visualization**: Countries styled based on ISP dominance data
6. **User Interaction**: Toggle controls modify visible map layers
7. **Dynamic Updates**: Map responds to user interactions without page refresh

## External Dependencies

### Client-Side Libraries
- **Leaflet.js 1.9.4**: Interactive mapping library (CDN)
- **Google Fonts**: Inter font family for typography (CDN)

### Map Tiles
- Default OpenStreetMap tiles or similar provider for base mapping

### Python Dependencies
- **Standard Library Only**: Uses built-in `http.server`, `socketserver`, and `os` modules
- No external Python packages required

## Deployment Strategy

### Development Environment
- **Replit Configuration**: Python 3.11 module with stable Nix channel
- **Run Command**: `python server.py`
- **Port**: 5000 (configured for Replit workflows)

### Production Considerations
- Static file deployment possible (no server-side processing required)
- Can be hosted on any static web hosting service
- Python server primarily for development convenience
- CORS headers configured for cross-origin access

### Scalability
- Client-side rendering reduces server load
- Static data embedded in JavaScript (no database queries)
- Cacheable assets for improved performance
